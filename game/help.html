            <p>Minesweeper is a classic logic puzzle game that challenges players to clear a grid of hidden mines without detonating any. The objective is to uncover all the non-mined squares while strategically using clues provided by the numbers on the grid to avoid the hidden mines.

                When a player clicks on a square, the game reveals either a number or a blank space. The number indicates how many mines are adjacent to that square. Using these clues, the player must carefully deduce the location of all mines. If the player accidentally clicks on a mine, the game is over.
                
                The game can be played in different levels of difficulty, typically based on grid size and the number of mines, ranging from beginner to expert.
                
                Minesweeper is not only a test of logic and strategy but also a game that enhances problem-solving skills and concentration. Each round of Minesweeper offers a new challenge, as the mine placements are randomized, keeping the game fresh and engaging every time you play.</p>

            <h3>How to Play Mindsweaper</h3>
              <p>Minesweeper is a game of logic and deduction where your goal is to uncover all the safe squares on a grid without clicking on a mine. Follow these steps to get started:</p><br><br>

                <h5>Starting the Game:</h5>
                
                <p>At the beginning, you will see a grid of squares. The size of the grid and the number of hidden mines vary based on the difficulty level you choose.
                Each square is either empty or contains a mine. You must avoid revealing the mines while trying to uncover the safe squares.</p>
                
                <h5>Revealing a Square:</h5>
                
               <p> Click on any square to reveal it. If it's an empty square, it will either display a number or clear an area.
                The number indicates how many mines are in the adjacent squares (this includes the squares diagonally, vertically, and horizontally around it).
                If you reveal an empty space with no adjacent mines, multiple squares will automatically be revealed, helping you clear more of the grid at once.</p>
                
                <h5>Flagging Mines:</h5>
                
               <p> If you suspect a square contains a mine, you can "flag" it by clicking the red flag icon, and then clicking the square you with you flag.
                Flagging is essential to keep track of potential mine locations, but be careful not to over-flag, as you have a limited number of flags matching the number of mines on the grid.</p>
                
                <h5>Using Clues:</h5>
                
                <p>The numbers are your clues. For example, if you see a square marked with "2", it means two of the adjacent squares are hiding mines. By using this information, you can figure out where the mines are located.
                Carefully analyze the surrounding squares before making your next move.</p>
               
                <h5>Winning and Losing:</h5>
                
                <p>You win the game when you have successfully flagged all the mines and uncovered all the safe squares.
                If you accidentally click on a square with a mine, the mine will detonate, and the game is over.</p>
                
                <h5>Tips for Success:</h5>
                
                <p>Start by clicking on squares near the corners or edges, as they often give better clues for the remaining grid.
                Use a combination of flagging and revealing to slowly uncover larger sections of the board safely.
                As you gain experience, youâ€™ll develop strategies to efficiently navigate the grid and minimize risk.</p>
